- has_many :through
- include AuthenticatedSystem should only be included in ApplicationController
- Private and public methods in controllers
- find(:all) and all()
- Indentation in views, long lines
- Avoid logic in views, setup data in controllers, use helpers
- Error messages remote forms
- operations/index: present?
- multiple named scopes or merge_conditions

def published_items
  scopes = [media_association_name, :published]
  scopes << events_scope if media_class == Event
  scopes.inject(@pressroom) { |source, scope| source.send(scope) }
end

- admin controller pattern
